# Rolo_Adventures
Rolo Adventures Game.

// Project Description:

Our first group project which took part in our 4th week @<Academia de CÃ³digo_> #68 Bootcamp @ Porto. We were challenged to create a game applying the features we had learned the previous weeks accomplished with the libraby "SimplesGraphics". Deadline for project deployment: 10 nights!

// The Idea:

After a long discuss we decided to create a game with our master coder as main character, in our classroom environment.

// Story:

It's friday night after a long week of classes. Our teacher Rolo just wants to relax and drink some beer. However, the codecadets are full of hard programming questions. Will Rolo be able to find his beers and drink them in peace? The mission is collecting all the beers, while escaping the codecadets.

//Development:

We implemented features one by one, (movement, colision, audio effects, graphic elements and user interface) mainly in pair programming, with extra details being coded individually.

//Tech && Methodologies:

Java 7, OOP, SimpleGFX Library, IntelliJ IDEA, Apache Ant, Git, Photoshop
